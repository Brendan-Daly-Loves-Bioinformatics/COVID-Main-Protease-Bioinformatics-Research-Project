# COVID-Main-Protease-Bioinformatics-Research-Project
Independent research using Python, BioPython, AutoDock Vina, and ChimeraX to research COVID main protease (Mpro), and how COVID-19 Mpro (6LU7) versus Omicron P132H Mpro (7TLL) can alter predicted binding of natural metabolites (not FDA approved). I want to research if there are any ligands that bind effectively across these two COVID variants, and be able to analyze and display the data in a unique way.
