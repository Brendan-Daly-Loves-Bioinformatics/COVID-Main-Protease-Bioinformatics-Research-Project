# COVID-19-Main-Protease-Bioinformatics-Research-Project
Independent research using BioPython and PyMOL to research COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) across variants. I'm looking to research how WT Mpro (6LU7) versus Omicron P132H Mpro (7TLL) can alter predicted binding of natural metabolites (not FDA approved), and if there are any ligands that bind effectively across these two SARS-CoV-2 variants.
