# COVID-Main-Protease-Bioinformatics-Research-Project
Independent research project using Python, BioPython, Modeller AutoDock Vina, and ChimeraX to research COVID main protease (Mpro), and how COVID-19 Mpro (6LU7) versus Omicron P132H Mpro (7TLL) can alter predicted binding of natural metabolites (not FDA approved). I want to research if there are any ligands that bind effectively across these two COVID variants. I hope to be able to analyze and present the data in a unique way, and explain how some ligands can stop COVID replication at an atomic level.
